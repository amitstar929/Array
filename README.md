üìå Program Description

This is a menu-driven C++ program (Program 6.27) that allows the user to perform operations on matrices.
The program dynamically allocates memory for matrices and provides the following functionalities:

‚úÖ Read and display an m x n matrix

‚úÖ Find the sum of two matrices

‚úÖ Find the transpose of a matrix

‚úÖ Find the product of two matrices

üéØ Menu Options

When you run the program, you will be asked to select an option:

1. Matrix Sum

2. Matrix Multiplication

3. Matrix Transpose

4. Exit

‚ö° Features

Uses Dynamic Memory Allocation (new and delete)
